###**History** 

Social Media has grown to become integral in the everyday lives of young adults. Simply look around at any public setting and you will notice individuals interacting in social media platforms such as Snapchat and Facebook. This concept came to light from being a part of this social media "generation," where it has become present in almost all aspects of our everyday life. Banking today is a completely disconnected yet crucial aspect of our lives. One of our team members lied in bed and came up with it while having trouble sleeping. 
 
 
 
###**Idea Description** 

Essentially, we are looking to add some social value to banking by creating milestones in a person's life. Our concept attempts to achieve this by establishing a system in which users are rewarded with virtual pins that can be shared across social media platforms. Banking to most young individuals is seen as an activity mostly associated with stress. By providing this aspect, we can help replace the negative stigma usually associated with banking with a new, and positive experience. We envision the implementation through financial milestones such as paying off student loans and making your first investment, along with streaks of savings deposits. We believe that implementing the idea of milestone-awarded virtual pins will encourage young bankers to frequent their bank accounts and develop good financial habits. 
 
 
###**Value to RBC** 

The value of socialized banking explores banking in a different aspect of our lives, and will encourage young adults to see RBC as a more attractive option for banking. Socialized banking has the ability to improve the financial habits of users with these "virtual awards" which will in turn establish a more financially stable userbase. 
 
 
###**Key Issues** 

The problem with associating social media with personal banking will always be the users' perceptions on the safety of their information. However, this can be avoided by defaulting the social media sharing of banking milestones to off. A well-informed page would further reassure users of their own safety.
